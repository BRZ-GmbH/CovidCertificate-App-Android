# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you have found a vulnerability, please immediately write an e-mail
to [cert@brz.gv.at](mailto:cert@brz.gv.at).

We take our user's data security very seriously and will triage and fix the vulnerability as soon as
possible. A first response is to be expected after one working day at maximum.

We currently do **NOT** run a VDP (**V**ulnerability **D**isclosure **P**rogram) and therefore are
not able to award you a bounty for a accepted vulnerability report.
